# Community Code of Conduct
### Last updated: October 1st, 2018

Everyone participating in the Datapolitan community—including, but not limited to the Datapolitan classes, Datapolitan seminars, and Datapolitan Slack channel—is required to agree to the following code of conduct. This includes all class attendees, speakers, meeting members, and observers.

Datapolitan will enforce this code during its classes and meetings, as well as any other engagements at which Datapolitan team members are present. We expect cooperation from everyone to ensure a safe, diverse, and welcoming environment.

## The Condensed Version
Datapolitan is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof), or veteran status. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. 

Sexist, racist, discriminatory, or harassing language and imagery is not appropriate in the Datapolitan community, in person or online. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from Datapolitan classes, meetings, or other events, the Slack channel, and all future events without a refund or other compensation at the discretion of Datapolitan.

## The Less Condensed Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or veteran status; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Exception: Discussion or images related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar is welcome if it meets all of the following criteria:

+ It is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists
+ It is presented in a respectful manner
+ Participants are respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand.

This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are required to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned behavior, Datapolitan may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender to immediately expelling the offender with no refund.

## Reporting and Enforcement
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Richard Dunks immediately. If you can’t or don’t wish to speak in person, or prefer to talk privately or electronically, contact us at conduct@datapolitan.com or by direct message in Slack.

All reports will be handled in the strictest confidence.

Datapolitan leadership will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the class, meeting, or other Datapolitan-sponsored event.
